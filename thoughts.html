		<p>Exercises shows some properties/examples from the theory. They shouldn't be approach with suspicion
but with interest. They help understand the course by making you prove/find new results from theory.</p>
<p>Write or consider abstract things to focus on the real problem. Wasting time on unnecessary things
makes you loose focus.
Link to real things when necessary.</p>
<p>It takes real understanding for real interest. To truly enjoy studying and using a concept, one
should have deep understanding of it. If it is vague, you can't have a global visualization of
what's going on.</p>
<p>Look in the middle of already made stuff/theories. Innovation is in understanding the hidden parts
of a system. Look for what's missing inbetween and that can enhance our comprehension and effects.</p>
<p>Drug is a way for the brain to reward itself. Addiction is when you can't control it. Anything that
gets you dopamine is potentially addictive.
Marijuana is not a drug of abuse.</p>
<p>You can't keep it all in  your head, you have to DO SOMETHING !
For that, I need energy. And energy comes from food, sleep and interest. Doing something interesting
will give you energy.</p>
<p>Knowing how people act, and why they do is a first step. Getting over some ridiculous things and
starting investigating deeper concepts.</p>
<p>You can't write like this, the way you do it is way to generalist, you have to give more examples
and to speak with more clarity. Use simple phrase and simple formulation. With simple words.
I could go on like this, just writing what pass by in my head.</p>
<p>Use tools efficiently to reduce action need.
Example:
    cat /usr/share/doc/mutt/samples/colors.linux &gt;&gt; ~/.mutt/muttrc
Example: prove a theorem using simple properties
The more concise it is, the better.</p>
<p>When stoned, I think it's better not to be. When normal, I want to get stoned. What is the solution
?</p>
