### Course projects

#### 2013

**Digital 3D Geometry Processing**

- [3D Statue Modeling from Photos](/projects/statues)  
	We captured a real statue from 360 with a camera, then used multiview reconstruction algorithms to create a 3D model of the statue. After digital mesh processing to smooth and denoise the 3D model, we used the Cube 3D printer to create a miniature solid object of the statue.

**Pattern classification and machine learning**

- Classification of image from the NORB 3D dataset and performance comparison of a **multilayer perceptron** and **linear classifiers**. [[github](https://github.com/damienfir/pcml)]  
	Authors: Damien Firmenich, Nicolas Voirol

#### 2012

**Advanced computer networks and distributed systems**

- **Drivr**: A cloud storage aggregator [[github](https://github.com/drivr/drivr)]  
	Authors: Damien Firmenich, Nicolas Sanglard, Bernard Gutermann

#### 2011

**Introduction to computer graphics**

- Water rendering using heightmaps [[github](https://github.com/damienfir/water_rendering)]  
	Authors: Damien Firmenich, Nicolas Sanglard, Louis Lettry

#### 2008

**Introduction to object-oriented programming**

- Peer to peer file sharing with encryption and FEC
