## Lytro

- [lfpsplitter](https://github.com/nrpatel/lfptools)  
Work with .lfp files

### Calibration
Calibration data is backuped the first time you synchronize the Lytro camera with the Lytro desktop software. On Windows, those files go in the folder `/Users/*/AppData/Local/Lytro` under the names `data.C.#`. They contain files which can be extracted using `lfpsplitter`.
