Notes from the book:

- Bodyweight training instead of weight training
- Functional because it makes the body move the way it was supposed to
- It trains a whole part of the body at once, instead of just a muscle at a time
- Helps strengthening joints and tendons as well
- Improves flexibility
- Do not use momentum
