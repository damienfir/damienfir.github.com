## 1. Eureka moments are the atoms of puzzles

Eureka moment: a sudden, pleasureful, fluent, confident feeling of understanding.
Like "Oh, I get it!" or an "Aha" moment.

## 2. Puzzles are isomorphic to humour

Eureka moment have many of the same positive feelings than a good joke.

## 3. Maximize the amount of sparkle

Sparkle: the "amplitude" of Eureka

## 4. Avoid the chaff

Like some boring words in a crossword puzzle.

## 5. Surprise is a key source of sparkle

## 6. Interesting truths are the root of surprises

## 7. Eureka is not Fiero

## 8. Different solvers seek different solving experiences

## 9. Eureka is shareable

## 10. Create many eureka moments

## 11. Create a rewarding ending

## 12. Embed secrets and surprises

## 13. Aporia is a promise of surprise

## 14. Cultivate the trust of the solver

## 15. Be careful with intransparencies

## 16. Facilitate experimentation

## 17. Get the solver on the right path

## 18. See depth in systems and rulesets

## 19. Understand your puzzle's state space

## 20. Understand your puzzle's solution path

## 21. Speak playfully to the solver

## 22. Design from the front

## 23. Make the key move provably unique

## 24. Add a theme

## 25. Don't be clever in ways that the solver will never notice

## 26. The format changes everything

## 27. Note-taking can increase depth

## 28. Beware of the temptations offered by the interactive medium

Physics:
Puzzle are often based on Eureka moments in a discrete state spaces. Physics is continuous. Difficult to know what is possible or not.

Statefulness:
For example Sokoban types have many states. Paper puzzle are stateless because it is just a solution on the paper. Sokoban need a sequence of actions.

The Witness is stateless. The puzzles are just a solution.
Monster's Expedition is stateful because you moved tree trunks around.

Linearity/plot-driven:
Building upon a previously solved puzzle.


Portal 2 for example broke a bunch of these guidelines, but they have the resources to make it interesting. But even then, they had to add a bunch of artificial helpers for the player.

## 29. Break the rules, sometimes perversely

## 30. Serendipity occurs when you're actively searching for good ideas

>> Great puzzles are often discovered, not invented

>> Notice your own Eureka moments and turn them into puzzles

-- explains the Witness puzzle on how Jon Blow could make such a hard puzzle work
He started to work on this puzzle and happen to find something that works out. It could be pure luck.
