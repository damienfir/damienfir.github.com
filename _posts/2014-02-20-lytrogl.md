title: "LytroGL: an OpenGL viewer for Lytro light field .lfp images"

Rendering a photograph from a light field image is computationally intensive. However it can be greatly sped up using a GPU for parallel processing. [LytroGL](https://github.com/damienfir/lytrogl) is a viewer for light field images using OpenGL. This software aims to provide an interactive interface to refocus `.lfp` images captured with the Lytro.

In previous post, I describe how to use the metadata in the `.lfp` files to correctly decode light field information from a raw 2D image.
