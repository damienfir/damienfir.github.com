One of the wireless module that comes on the Lenovo T450s is the Realtek 8192ee, which has bad support out of the box on Arch Linux.

The solution that fixed my setup is the following:

1. Get the latest driver from the repo [https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new](https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new)

        git clone git@github.com:lwfinger/rtlwifi_new.git

2. Compile them on your system

        cd rtlwifi_new
        make

3. Install them

        sudo make install

4. Reboot

The kernel module should be automatically loaded when the system boots. If not, load them with the following command

    sudo modprobe rtl8192ee


If you are still having problem connecting to an encrypted network, add the following options to the module

    echo "options rtl8192ee swenc=1" > /etc/modprobe.conf/rtl8192ee.conf
    sudo rmmod rtl8192ee
    sudo modprobe rtl8192ee
