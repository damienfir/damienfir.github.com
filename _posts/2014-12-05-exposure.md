With a focus on fluid interactivity while manipulating RAW images, **exposure** is implemented with OpenCL in mind. It is written in C++ with GTK for the user interface.

Image processing is a task particularly well suited for GPU processing, as most filters operate pixel-wise and hence can be ran in parallel on a single image. **exposure** aims to bring state-of-the-art digital negative development to the Linux desktop for photographers.

The source code is available on [github](https://github.com/damienfir/exposure).
