Vertex Array has to be re-sent each time but VBO can be mapped to the client array (manipulate vertices from the GPU).

### GLSL
attributes: pass data from program (like vertex)
varying: pass data from vs to fs
uniform: constant for all vertex

### Mistakes to avoid
- consistency between OpenGL and language types
- verify matrix computation
- -z or z
- object maybe behind camera
